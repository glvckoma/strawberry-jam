## About

**Jam** is a modular man-in-the-middle proxy for Animal Jam.

## Note

The latest Animal Jam patch requires you to disable their "secure mode" within the client. 

If you are unable to disable that mode, Jam has the latest client with the mode already disabled, however, due to these restrictions you must now use the built in patcher in order to use Jam, don't forget to unpatch whenever you're done using Jam.
