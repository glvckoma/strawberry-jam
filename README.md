## About

**Jam** is a modular man-in-the-middle proxy for Animal Jam.

## Note

The latest Animal Jam patch requires you to disable their "secure mode" within the client. 

If you are unable to disable that mode, Jam has the latest client with the mode already disabled, however, due to these restrictions you must now use the built in patcher in order to use Jam, don't forget to unpatch whenever you're done using Jam.

## A modification note by Auth Zero

I DID NOT BUILD THIS TOOL, I simply added a feature to further enhance the tool

You may have noticed a small change: A "Hosts Settings" option.
This option allows you to choose between using the changing the hosts file (which requires admin on windows) or opening the animal jam app without having to modify the hosts file. DON'T FORGET TO UNPATCH AFTER USE!!!!
If you find any bugs regarding the hosts settings feature, please either open an issue, or email me at authxero@gmail.com
