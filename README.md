## 🍓 What's Different from the Original Jam?

Strawberry Jam is a fork of the original [Jam](https://github.com/Sxip/jam) project, with new features, plugins, and improvements not found in the original.  
See [Strawberry Jam vs. Jam: What's Different?](community-guide/strawberry-jam-vs-jam.md) for a friendly and technical comparison.

## 🚀 Quick Start

###  Windows
1.  Download `Strawberry-Jam-Setup.exe` from our [latest release](https://github.com/glvckoma/strawberry-jam/releases/latest)
2.  Run the installer
3.  Launch Strawberry Jam from your Start menu

###  MacOS

1.  Go to the [latest release page](https://github.com/glvckoma/strawberry-jam/releases/latest).
2.  Download the file ending in `.zip` (like `Strawberry-Jam-mac-1.0.2.zip`) or (`strawberry-jam-1.0.1-arm64-mac.zip.`)
3.  Find the downloaded `.zip` file (usually in your Downloads folder) and double-click it to unzip. This will create a **Strawberry Jam.app** file.
4.  Drag the **Strawberry Jam.app** file into your **Applications** folder.
5.  **Important First Run:** You need to open the **Terminal** app (you can find it using Spotlight search - the magnifying glass at the top right).
6.  Carefully copy and paste this *exact* command into the Terminal and press Enter:
    ```bash
    sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Strawberry\ Jam.app
    ```
    *   **Why do I need to do this?** Your Mac has a security guard called Gatekeeper. When you download apps from the internet (like Strawberry Jam), Gatekeeper gets a little suspicious and puts them in "quarantine" just in case. This command tells Gatekeeper, "Hey, this Strawberry Jam app is safe, you can let it run!"
    *   It will ask for your Mac's login password. Type it in (you won't see anything appear as you type, that's normal!) and press Enter.
    *   You only need to do this command **one time** after installing or updating Strawberry Jam!
7.  Now you can open **Strawberry Jam** from your Applications folder like any other app!

> **⚠️ Mac Compatibility Note:** Strawberry Jam is mostly built and tested on Windows. While we try to make it work on Mac, you might run into some bugs or things that look a little different. If you find problems, please let us know by [creating an issue](https://github.com/glvckoma/strawberry-jam/issues)!

## ✨ Features

*   **🔍 Network Analysis:** Watch messages between your game and AJ's servers
*   **🔌 Plugin System:** Add cool new features with plugins
*   **🖥️ Easy to Use:** Simple desktop app with everything you need

## ⚠️ Important Warning!

Using tools like Strawberry Jam might break the game's rules and result in account termination. Please be careful and use it responsibly. Neither I nor Sxip are responsible for any loss of accounts.
