  "850": "Barrel sponges are some of the largest of all sponge species, with some growing up to six feet tall!\n\nBarrel sponges live mainly in the tropical waters of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, but scientists have recently discovered huge sponge populations in the Caribbean. They estimate that some of these sponges are 2000 years old!",
  "851": "True oysters can be eaten cooked, raw, smoked, or canned. Sadly, these oysters produce dull and misshapen pearls.\n\nPearl oysters cannot be eaten, but they form beautiful, round pearls. These pearls are formed when something small, like sand, gets stuck in an oyster. Over time, the oyster wraps it in layers of nacre, which lines the inside of its shell.",
  "852": "Sea cucumbers can grow to over six feet long!\n\nWhen they are threatened, sea cucumbers can eviscerate themselves. That means they shoot their internal organs out of their bodies to trap or scare predators!\n\nAfter escaping, sea cucumbers' organs regenerate, or grow back, in about six weeks.",
  "853": "Male elephant seals have a large proboscis, or noselike appendage, that resembles an elephant's trunk. They can even inflate it!\n\nElephant seals can dive down to over 1500 feet below the surface of the ocean.\n\nWhen underwater, elephant seals can hold their breath for up to 100 minutes!",
  "854": "Like oysters, scallops are bivalves. But unlike other bivalves, scallops are migratory, which means they like to swim around.\n\nSome scallops can \"sing\" by making a soft popping noise as they flap open and closed while swimming!\n\nScallops have lots of little eyes that line the edges of their mantle.",
  "855": "Marlins belong to the billfish family, which also includes sailfish and spearfish. They have long, rounded, spearlike noses that they use to slash and stab at schools of smaller fishes!\n\nKnown for putting up a tremendous fight when hooked, marlins are one of the hardest fish for sport fishers to catch.",
  "856": "When flounders are young, they swim close to the surface and have an eye on each side of their head. They soon start leaning to one side, and both eyes slowly shift to what eventually becomes their top side.\n\nTo protect themselves, flounders have been known to change colors from their normal grayish-brown to shades of blue, orange, and even pink!",
  "857": "Like corals, barnacles form calcium carbonate shells for protection.\n\nBarnacles attach themselves to piers, rocks, and even ships using their heads!\n\nOnce attached, barnacles use their small and feathery legs called cirri to trap small particles of food that float by.",
  "858": "Scientists used to think that tube sponges were plants, but have since found that they are very simple animals. Sponges have no organs, but they do have cells that help them pull water through their pores to collect microscopic food particles.\n\nTube sponges are delicate and tear easily, so they are usually found in deeper waters where waves and currents have a smaller effect.",
  "859": "Brain coral gets its name because it looks like an underwater brain!\n\nBrain corals are made of polyps, small tubelike structures that attach themselves to surfaces like rocks.\n\nOnce attached, they wave their mouths and tentacles in the water to catch food.",
  "860": "Staghorn coral is a stony coral that gets its name from its resemblance to the horns of a stag, or male deer. Like other living corals, staghorn corals are made from small polyps that attach themselves to surfaces.\n\nMuch like their jellyfish relatives, corals use their nematocysts, or small stinging structures, to paralyze their prey.",
  "861": "Feather duster worms live in long tubes. These tubes are built out of sand and mud, and are held together with mucus!\n\nFeather duster worms get their name from the frilly crown of fine tentacles attached to either side of their heads. They extend these tentacles out to breathe and eat, but quickly retract them at the first sign of danger.",
  "862": "Sea Urchin",
  "863": "Like crabs and shrimps, lobsters have five pairs of legs. On many lobsters, the first set of legs has large claws at the end, with one claw being larger than the other! They can grow new legs and claws if they lose one by accident or to a predator.\n\nIn the wild, most lobsters are greenish-brown, orange, blue, and even purple!",
  "864": "Stingrays are flat, disk-shaped creatures that have long, sharp, and usually spiny tails. They are also known as whip-tailed rays, and they can whip their tails with enough force to puncture a wooden boat!\n\nSome stingrays can use the natural suction of their fins to uproot clams that are buried in the sandy ocean floor!",
  "865": "Pufferfish are known for their ability to puff up like a balloon when they are disturbed!\n\nMany species of pufferfish are very poisonous, and they are usually covered in prickly skin.\n\nIn Japan, specially trained chefs prepare pufferfish as food after they carefully remove the poisonous glands and organs.",
  "866": "Clownfish are also called anemonefish because they make their homes in sea anemones. Their bodies produce a protective layer of slime that protects them from the anemones' spines.\n\nSea anemones protect and shelter clownfish, and clownfish help the anemones by cleaning up and eating small leftovers. This is called a symbiotic relationship.",
  "867": "Humpback whales are baleen whales, which means they strain krill, plankton, and small fish out of the water by forcing it through the spongelike baleen in their mouths.\n\nHumpback whales are the most vocal of all whales. They will \"sing\" songs alone or in groups for up to 35 minutes at a time! Their \"songs\" even change as the years pass.",
  "868": "There are over 200 species of anglerfish. Most of them live at the bottom of ocean!\n\nFemale anglerfish have a dorsal spine that sticks out above their mouths. The tip of this spine is bioluminescent, which means it glows.\n\nAnglerfish use this glowing lure as bait to attract smaller fish.",
  "869": "Viperfish live up to 13,000 feet below the surface, and like some other deep-sea dwellers, they have bioluminescent, or glowing, organs on their bodies. They use these glowing photophores to attract their prey.\n\nViperfish only reach about eight inches long, but their jagged, needlelike teeth are so oversized that they can't close their mouths!",
  "871": "Fangtooth fish are some of the deepest-living fish ever discovered. They have been found as shallow as 6500 feet and as deep as 16,500 feet below the surface! That's over three miles deep!\n\nFangtooth fish are only about six inches long, but their scary-looking teeth, when measured in proportion to their body size, are the largest of any fish!",
  "872": "Gulper eels live in the dark depths of the ocean, and have been found living 9,000 feet below the surface!\n\nGulper eels get their name from their enormous mouths, and some gulper eels have mouths that are longer than their bodies! Because they have expandable stomachs, they can eat food that is bigger than they are!",
  "873": "Most giant squids grow to over 30 feet long and weigh over 400 pounds, but the biggest giant squid ever measured was almost 60 feet long and weighed almost 2000 pounds!\n\nMeasuring in at the size of a beach ball, giant squids' eyes are the biggest in the animal kingdom. Giant squids use these huge eyes to see the murky and dark depths of the oceans.",
  "875": "Giant isopods are crustaceans, and are related to shrimp, crabs, and even tiny pill bugs! They are the largest of all known isopods.\n\nGiant isopods are believed to live in the deep waters of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.\n\nGiant isopods are scavengers, meaning they eat dead sea creatures.",
  "876": "Coelacanths are elusive deep-sea creatures, and most live up to 2300 feet below the surface!\n\nCoelacanths can grow to over six feet long and can live for up to 60 years!\n\nCoelacanths were thought to have gone extinct with the dinosaurs, but in 1938, a live specimen was caught off the coast of South Africa!",
  "879": "Hatchetfish get their name because their bodies are shaped like a hatchet, or small axe.\n\nHatchetfish have a row of bioluminescent, or glowing, organs that line their bellies. \n\nHatchetfish's glowing organs shine like daylight from the ocean surface when seen from below, and are used to confuse predators.",
  "880": "Oarfish are long, thin, ribbon-shaped fish that can grow up to 35 feet long and weigh over 600 pounds!\n\nOarfish live in deep waters around the globe and are rarely seen at the surface. Today, many believe that oarfish were the inspiration for the giant \"sea serpents\" that sailors reported seeing throughout history!",
  "883": "Most frogfish live in reefs, and they rely on camouflage to stay hidden and protected.\n\nDifferent frogfish have stripes, spots, warts, and other skin features that allow them to imitate the surrounding rocks and plants.\n\nSome frogfish can even change their colors to blend in!",

Hold the cup firmly in one hand, and fold the damp paper towel around the string near the cup. Squeeze the paper towel and pull down on the string in short jerks so that the paper towel slides down the string.",

Once your straw has been cut, flatten out the cut end again.\n\nTake a really deep breath and blow through the pointed end of the straw. Have your parent try blowing through the straw as well.",
  "9837": "What Happens:",
  "9839": "You should hear a sound just like a quacking duck! If you have trouble, try flattening the straw some more, or ask your parent to cut the straw in half so that it's shorter.",
  "9841": "How it works:",
  "9844": "The vibrations of your breath going through the straw create the duck-like sound that you heard. When you blow through the straw, the pieces of the triangle you cut vibrate quickly against each other, and that vibration is the sound you hear. \n\nDid you know all sounds come from vibrations? Keep experimenting and try this same process with a different length straw or even one with a different diameter. Do you hear a difference?",

They'll feed on anything they can get their jaws on, including water buffalo, monkeys, wild boar, and even sharks!\n\nSaltwater croc hides are valued above all other crocodilians, and illegal hunting, habitat loss, and hostility because of its reputation as a man-eater continue to put pressure on the skrinking population.",

During the day, koalas snooze--tucked into forks or nooks in the trees--and sleep for up to 18 hours.\n\nKoalas do not drink much water, they get mose of their moisture from the eucalyptus leaves. They can take on a distinctive smell from the leaves, similar to that of cough drops.\n\nKoalas need a lot of space (about a hundred trees per animal), and as a result have become endangered by the shrinking woodlands of Australia.\n",

  "19887": "Polar bears spend most of their time on the arctic sea ice and in the ocean. They are marine animals, and they're sometimes called \"sea bear\".",
  "19888": "Did You Know?",
  "19889": "It is a common misconception that polar bears and penguins live together.\n\nPolar bears live in the far north, and penguins live in the southern hemisphere.",
  "19890": "Facts & Figures",
  "19891": "Polar bears live in the US, Russia, Greenland, Canada, and Norway.",
  "19892": "The average male polar bear weighs 1200 pounds and is over 5 feet tall at its shoulder!",
  "19893": "Because polar bears are so large, walking takes 13 times more energy than sitting.",
  "19894": "Polar Bear Habitat",
  "19895": "Arctic Ice Floes",
  "19896": "Polar bears spend most of their time on and around ice floes, giant sheets of ice that float and drift on the Arctic sea. Though the Arctic may seem like a frozen, barren place, it is actually teeming with life. It is home to many different land and marine mammals, as well as birds, fish, insects, and plants.",

  "19899": "The Arctic is filled with amazing wildlife. Draw a picture of your favorite arctic animal.",
  "19900": "Social Behavior",

  "19918": "Polar Bear Diet",
  "19919": "Polar bears are carnivores, and their diet consists mostly of seals. They have also been known to eat birds, fish, and eggs.",
  "19920": "Because they have thick layers of fat, seals are an energy-rich food source. Polar bears eat as much seal fat as possible to build their own fat reserves; these reserves help polar bears survive when food is scarce.",
  "19921": "Communication",
  "19922": "Body language and vocalization are hallmarks of bear communication. While snorting and growling may signify aggression, head wagging often offers play, and nose touching might be a request for something.",

  "21472": "Hunting",
  "21473": "All owls hunt, but unlike other birds, most owls have special feathers on their wings that soften the sound of the wind.

That's faster than most cars!\n\nAlmost all of these incredible big cats live in Africa below the Sahara Desert, with a few small groups living in Northern Africa and Iran.",
  "22324": "Cheetahs are the smallest of all the big cat species. They are also the only big cats that belong to a different genus.\n\nCheetahs don't roar like other big cat species: they purr. They also moan, snarl, hiss, and chirp!",
  "22325": "Cheetahs can sprint at speeds of up to 70 miles per hour!",
  "22326": "Mother cheetahs usually give birth to three to five cubs per litter, but some litters can have up to eight cubs!",
  "22327": "Scientists estimate there are only 7500 to 10,000 cheetahs left in the wild.",
  "22328": "Cheetah Habitat",
  "22329": "African Savanna",
  "22330": "Cheetahs share their African savanna home with a number of other incredible animals. Giraffes, zebras, warthogs, hyenas, and lions are all sympatric species, which is a term scientists use to describe different animals that all live in the same area.",
  "22331": "Curious Creatures",
  "22332": "African savannas are home to thousands of different animals of all shapes and sizes. Research savanna life to see if you can learn of an animal you've never heard of before.",
  "22333": "Unless they are raising cubs, female cheetahs are solitary, which means they live on their own. Male cheetahs, usually brothers, live and hunt together in small groups called coalitions.",
  "22334": "Terrific Territory",

  "22343": "Cheetah Diet",
  "22344": "Cheetahs are carnivores, which means they eat meat. They use their immense speed to chase down and capture their prey, which can range from rabbits and birds to ostriches and gazelles. Cheetahs are timid animals, and they must eat their meals quickly before other predators can scare them away and steal their food!",
  "22345": "Fast Feet",
  "22346": "Time how long it takes you to run a short distance when you are barefoot, in socks, and in shoes. Which time is the fastest? Why do you think that is?",
  "22347": "Super Speed",
  "22348": "Cheetahs' bodies are built for speed! Their flexible spines allow them to stretch their long legs far forward when running, helping them cover 20 feet in just one stride!\n\nCheetahs use their large tails like a boat's rudder to help them steer while running, and because they can't fully retract their claws, their paws act like running cleats to grip the ground and make every step count.",
  "22349": "Even though there aren't too many spotted plants on the African savanna, the pattern of cheetahs' spots actually gives them camouflage, or a way to hide, among plants and rocks of different colors, shapes, and sizes.",

The llama will cry out to warn the sheep if danger approaches, and they will even drive off coyotes and other predators!",

  "25224": "From snout to curly tail, pigs are a familiar and easily recognizable sight all over the world. These highly social and intelligent animals were first domesticated 10,000 years ago and are well-known for their habit of wallowing in mud to cool off and for searching, or rooting, in the ground with their snout for food.",
  "25225": "Pigs are some of the smartest domesticated animals, and in some ways they are considered smarter than dogs!\n\nA group of pigs is called a drift or a passel.",
  "25226": "Pigs are also sometimes referred to as swine.",

  "25386": "3. You may have noticed that batteries have positive (+) and negative (-) ends. On the lemon battery the copper is positive and the nail is negative.",
  "25387": "4. Touch the copper and zinc with the same hand. What do you notice as you complete this circuit?",
  "25388": "5. You can take this experiment to the next level by turning a few more lemons into batteries. Two to four lemons should have enough juice to power up a small LED bulb. Connect the lemons with the alligator clips - each clip should attach a nail to a penny. You should have two loose clips at the end to connect to the LED bulb. Attach these clips to the bulb and watch what happens!",
  "25389": "6. The lemons aren't creating energy on their own but are a part of the battery. The citric acid in the lemon is perfect for electrons (small particles) to flow through. The zinc from the nail oxidizes in the citric acid, releasing electrons. These electrons flow when a circuit is completed. Try this experiment with a potato or apple and see if you can create a similar reaction!",

  "25395": "• 1 cup half & half (you can also try this experiment with milk, or a non-dairy substitute)\n• 3 tablespoons sugar\n• 1⁄2 teaspoon vanilla extract\n• Ice cubes\n• 8 tablespoons rock salt\n• 1 pint size and 1 gallon plastic baggie\n• Mixing bowl",
  "25396": "1. Combine the half & half (or other liquid) with the sugar and vanilla in the mixing bowl.",
  "25397": "2. Take this mixture and pour into the pint sized plastic baggie – close tightly!",
  "25398": "3. Fill the gallon baggie halfway with ice and then pour the salt on top.",
  "25399": "4. Place the bag with your ice cream mixture on top of the ice and salt. Close the large bag – make sure there are no leaks.",
  "25400": "5. Shake for about 5 minutes or until the ice cream mixture freezes. This works because the salt makes the ice melt and get colder. The ice cream mixture also transfers some of its heat to the ice, which speeds up the melting and chilling process.",
  "25401": "6. Carefully remove the bag with the frozen ice cream and enjoy your cold treat on a hot day! You can experiment by adding other flavors to your ice cream or changing ratios of ingredients to see if you can get your ice cream to freeze faster or slower.",

  "25404": "• Salt\n• Paper\n• Watercolor paint\n• Paint brushes\n• Glue",
  "25405": "1. There are a couple different ways you can use salt to make amazing works of art! The first is to paint with watercolors on the paper and then sprinkle some salt over your images. Watch what happens when the salt touches the paint!",
  "25406": "2. Another technique you can use is to make designs or images using glue. Cover the glue with the salt and let it dry. Then, use your watercolor paint to add color to the raised image you made!",
  "25407": "3. See if there is anything else you can come up with! Try different types of salt, like table salt or sea salt and see if that changes your painting. Have fun getting creative!",
