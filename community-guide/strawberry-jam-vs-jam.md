# Strawberry Jam vs. Jam: What's Different?

---

## üçì For Everyone (Kids/Easy-to-Read)

**Strawberry Jam** is a special, improved version of the original Jam project for Animal Jam Classic. Here‚Äôs what makes it different and better:

- **New Tools!**
  - **Login Packet Manipulator:** Lets you change how you log in (not possible in the original Jam).
  - **Account Tester:** Helps you check lots of accounts quickly and safely.
  - **Username Logger:** Collects and checks usernames for you.

- **Safety & Privacy**
  - **UUID Rotation:** Changes your computer‚Äôs ID to help you stay safe (but you‚Äôll need to use OTP every time).
  - **LeakCheck Integration:** Checks usernames with a special database (you‚Äôll need your own API key).

- **Cleaner & Faster**
  - **Auto-Clearing Logs:** Console and network logs clear themselves after 600 messages, so things never get too messy or slow.

- **Just for Fun**
  - More features and improvements are coming all the time!

## üõ†Ô∏è For Developers & Power Users

### **Why Fork?**

Implementing advanced features like the login packet manipulator, semi-automatic account tester, and robust username logger required significant changes to Jam‚Äôs core. These features are not compatible with the original Jam and are unique to Strawberry Jam.
