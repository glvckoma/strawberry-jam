## 👋 For Everyone

Think of network packets like letters being sent back and forth between friends:

### 📨 Types of Messages

*   **⬆️ Messages You Send (Yellow Up Arrow)**
    *   When you want to move your animal
    *   When you type in chat
    *   When you try to buy something
*   **⬇️ Messages You Receive (Green Down Arrow)**
    *   Where other players are
    *   What others are saying
    *   If you got a new item

### 📝 What the Messages Look Like

The text might look like computer code, but there are patterns you can spot:
*   Messages between `< >` are called **XML** messages
*   Messages between `% %` are called **XT** messages

### 🔍 Fun Things to Watch For

*   **💭 Chat Messages:** Look for `%xt%c%...%`
*   **🏃 Movement:** Watch the messages when you walk around
*   **🎮 Actions:** See what happens when you click buttons!

Don't worry if it seems confusing - just watching the messages flow can be interesting!
